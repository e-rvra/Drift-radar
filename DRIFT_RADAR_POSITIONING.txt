DRIFT RADAR — CONCEPTUAL & TECHNICAL POSITIONING
============================================================

Purpose
-------
Drift Radar is a lightweight analysis instrument designed to surface
signals of *structural drift* in evolving codebases.

Its purpose is not to evaluate code quality, correctness, or style.
It exists to help humans perceive how the *structure* of a system
changes over time.

Drift Radar answers a single question:

"Is this repository evolving smoothly, or is it drifting
in a non-trivial and potentially invisible way?"

------------------------------------------------------------

What Drift Radar Detects
-----------------------
Drift Radar focuses on *structural amplification*, not raw change.

It observes how modifications interact with the existing structure
of a repository, rather than how large those modifications appear
in isolation.

Typical observable signals include:
- concentration or dispersion of changes over time
- repeated interaction with structurally central areas
- gradual growth of coupling surfaces
- imbalance between change size and structural impact
- deviation from historical evolution patterns

These signals are intentionally synthetic and non-decomposable.
They are not meant to be reverse-engineered into individual metrics
or atomic scores.

Drift Radar captures *emergent behavior*, not isolated properties.

------------------------------------------------------------

What Drift Radar Explicitly Does NOT Do
--------------------------------------
Drift Radar does NOT attempt to:
- find bugs
- assess correctness
- judge code quality
- enforce best practices
- block merges
- replace human review
- produce pass/fail decisions

It is not a linter.
It is not a static analyzer.
It is not a CI gate.
It is not an automated reviewer.
It is not a decision engine.

Drift Radar produces *signals*, not verdicts.

------------------------------------------------------------

How Drift Radar Is Used
----------------------
Drift Radar is typically executed on Pull Requests.

A standard workflow is:
1. A Pull Request is opened
2. Drift Radar analyzes the change in the context of repository history
3. A single, stable comment is posted on the PR

The comment contains:
- a synthetic drift signal
- qualitative indicators for interpretation
- contextual framing
- no blocking instruction
- no enforcement mechanism

Developers and reviewers remain fully in control.

------------------------------------------------------------

Interpreting the Output
----------------------
Drift Radar output should be read as a *warning light*, not as a rule.

Examples of valid interpretations include:
- "This change is small but interacts with structurally central areas"
- "This PR amplifies an existing long-term drift pattern"
- "This change alters assumptions that historically remained stable"

A high drift signal does NOT mean:
- the change is incorrect
- the PR must be rejected
- the architecture is necessarily wrong

It means:
- the change deserves attention
- the change may warrant discussion
- the long-term impact may not be obvious at first glance

The drift signal should be understood as an *emergent indicator*,
not as the sum of individual factors.

------------------------------------------------------------

Why Drift Radar Exists
---------------------
Most software tooling focuses on local properties:
- syntax
- style
- correctness
- test coverage
- performance

Drift Radar focuses on *system-level evolution*.

It exists to help humans perceive:
- slow structural degradation
- implicit architectural shifts
- accumulation of invisible risk
- long-term imbalance in complex systems

Drift Radar is concerned with evolution, not evaluation.

------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration Philosophy
------------------------
Drift Radar is intentionally configuration-light.

Structural drift is highly context-dependent, and excessive
configuration tends to obscure rather than clarify signals.

Defaults are designed to remain:
- stable
- interpretable
- comparable over time

Over-exposing internal dimensions or tunable parameters would
encourage metric-driven behavior and reduce the validity of the signal.

Advanced configuration, when available, is optional and minimal.

------------------------------------------------------------

Intended Audience
-----------------
Drift Radar is intended for:
- engineers maintaining long-lived systems
- research and exploratory R&D teams
- infrastructure and tooling maintainers
- teams studying software evolution over time
- projects without a single architectural owner

It is not intended for:
- strict compliance enforcement
- automated decision pipelines
- performance scoring
- managerial evaluation

------------------------------------------------------------

Design Positioning
------------------
Drift Radar is deliberately not based on pattern learning,
heuristics trained on external datasets, or predictive models.

It does not attempt to infer intent, correctness, or future outcomes.

Instead, it operates as a structural observation instrument,
designed to remain stable, interpretable, and resistant to drift
in its own behavior as repositories evolve.

------------------------------------------------------------

License and Usage
-----------------
Drift Radar is released as an open and permissive instrument.

License: MIT

It may be used, modified, and redistributed freely, including
for commercial purposes.

This repository contains only the Drift Radar implementation.
Conceptual frameworks and research models developed by ErvraTech
(e.g. CIM) are governed by separate licenses and are not included
in this repository.

------------------------------------------------------------

Positioning
-----------
Drift Radar is developed by :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
as part of a broader research effort on drift, stability, and
long-term behavior in complex systems.


------------------------------------------------------------

Guiding Principle
-----------------
"Drift Radar does not tell you what to do.
It helps you see what is changing."
