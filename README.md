# Drift Radar — GitHub Action

**Detect risky changes before they hit production.**

Drift Radar analyses Pull Requests and computes a **Drift Score (0–100)** that estimates how structurally risky a change is — not just how big it is.

👉 Result: an **automatic Pull Request comment** with a clear verdict.

---

## What Drift Radar does

Drift Radar answers one simple question:

> *“Does this change quietly introduce long-term risk?”*

It looks beyond raw diff size and focuses on **structural drift**.

### It detects:
- Changes touching **core files**
- **Configuration & infrastructure drift**
- Dependency and API surface changes
- Repeated low-level changes that accumulate risk
- PRs that are *small but dangerous*

---

## Output

For every Pull Request, Drift Radar posts a comment like:


Color code:
- 🟢 **0–30** → Low risk  
- 🟡 **31–60** → Moderate drift  
- 🔴 **61–100** → High structural risk  

---

## How it works (high level)

Drift Radar computes a composite score based on:
- File criticality
- Change amplification patterns
- Structural vs cosmetic modifications
- Historical drift signals

📌 No ML  
📌 Deterministic  
📌 Fast  
📌 Zero configuration by default
